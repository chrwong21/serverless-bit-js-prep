## About Me
I am a student at UIC and I'll be an upcoming junior this Fall semester. I recently finally made the switch over to majoring in computer science in the College of Engineering after having been a chemistry major the first two years of my undergraduate career. Right now I am currently working as a Software Engineer Intern at GE Healthcare for the summer while also participating in the Bit Project in the general program. During the school year, I'm primarily focused on just my studies, so the summer is a great opportunity for me to work on a personal project, which the Bit Project is helping me get jumpstarted on that.
